### Ames Iowa Dataset Predict Property Prices

The data of this assignment refer to the database of the Ames City Assessor’s Office. It includes a large number of variables and observations within the data set and they refer 
to 2930 property sales that had occurred in Ames, Iowa between 2006 and 2010. A mix of 82 nominal, ordinal, continuous, and discrete variables were used in the calculation of the 
assessed values. The dataset included physical property measurements in addition to computation variables used in the city’s assessment process. All variables focus on the 
quality and quantity of many physical attributes of the property. Most of the variables are exactly the type of information that a typical home buyer would want to know about a 
potential property (e.g. When was it built? How big is the lot? How many feet of living space is in the dwelling? Is the basement finished? How many bathrooms are there?). For 
more details see at De Cock (2011).
